# DataStructures_lab_programs

1. Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program in C for the following

   a) To create an Array of N Integer Elements and store n values.
   • Inserting an Element (ELEM) at a given valid Position (POS)
   • Deleting an Element at a given valid Position POS)
   • Display of Array Elements
   • Exit.
   Support the program with functions for each of the above operations.

   b) To create student structure with fields Roll No, Name, Semester, marks in 3 subjects. And Write functions to
   • Enter 5 students’ details and display the same using pointer to structure
   • Find Student wise and subject wise total marks and display the same.

2. Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on
   a) STACK of Integers (Array with structure Implementation of Stack with size MAX)
   • Push an Element on to Stack.
   • Pop an Element from Stack.
   • Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow situations on Stack.
   • Display the status of Stack .
   • Exit
3. Queue of Integers (Array with structure Implementation of Queue with size MAX)
   • Insert an Element in to Queue.
   • Delete an Element from Queue.
   • Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow situations on Queue.
   • Display the status of Queue .
   • Exit
   Support the program with appropriate functions for each of the above operations

4. Design, Develop and Implement a Program in C for the following Stack Applications
   • Evaluation of Suffix expression with single digit operands and operators: +, -, \*, /, %, ^ b
5. Design, Develop and Implement a Program in C for converting an Infix Expression to Postfix Expression. Program should support for both parenthesized and free parenthesized expressions with the operators: +, -, \*, /, % (Remainder), ^ (Power) and alphanumeric operands

6. Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on Circular QUEUE of Characters (Array Implementation of Queue with maximum size MAX)
   • Insert an Element on to Circular QUEUE.
   • Delete an Element from Circular QUEUE.
   • Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow situations on Circular QUEUE d. Display the status of Circular QUEUE.
   • Exit
   Support the program with appropriate functions for each of the above operations

7. Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on Singly Linked List (SLL) for data of integers.
   • Create a SLL of Data using front insertion.
   • Display the status of SLL and count the number of nodes in it.
   • Demonstration of stack
   • Demonstration of Queue.
   • Exit

8. Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on Circular Singly Linked List (CSLL) for data of integers.
   • Create a CSLL of data using front insertion.
   • Perform Insertion and Deletion to the right of the given node.
   • Perform Insertion and Deletion at end of CSLL.
   • Display the status of CSLL and count the number of nodes in it.
   • Exit

9. Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on Doubly Linked List (DLL) for data of integers.
   • Create a DLL of data .
   • Perform Insertion and Deletion at End of DLL.
   • Perform Insertion and Deletion at Front of DLL.
   • Display the status of DLL and count the number of nodes in it.
   • Exit

10. Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on Binary Search Tree (BST) of integers .
    • Create a BST of N Integers: 6, 9, 5, 2, 8, 15, 24, 14, 7, 8, 5, 2.
    • Traverse the BST in Inorder, Preorder and Post Order.
    • Search the BST for a given element (KEY) and report the appropriate message.
    • Exit
